# Python project: CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System
Between 1971 and 2023, the United States recorded approximately 66,000 outbreaks, with 49% attributed  to person-to-person spread and 38% to foodborne transmission. To gain deeper insights into these outbreaks, it is essential to analyze trends over time, examine the primary modes of transmission, and assess how outbreaks vary across different states.

The analysis focuses on three key areas to better understand these outbreaks:
1.	How have outbreak patterns changed over the years?
2.	Which states account for the highest percentage of reported outbreaks?
3.	Which pathogens are associated with the greatest number of outbreaks, illnesses, and deaths?

# Data Set
The dataset used in this project comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — specifically the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).
It contains detailed reports of foodborne, waterborne, and related disease outbreaks that occurred in the United States.
Each record represents one outbreak and includes information such as the year, month, state, etiology (cause), illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.
