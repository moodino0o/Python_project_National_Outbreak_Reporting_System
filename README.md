# Python project: CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System
Between 1971 and 2023, the United States recorded approximately 66,000 outbreaks, with 49% attributed  to person-to-person spread and 38% to foodborne transmission. To gain deeper insights into these outbreaks, it is essential to analyze trends over time, examine the primary modes of transmission, and assess how outbreaks vary across different states.

The approach of the analysis is:
1.	How have outbreak patterns changed over the years?
2.	Which states account for the highest percentage of reported outbreaks?
3.	Which pathogens are associated with the greatest number of outbreaks, illnesses, and deaths?
